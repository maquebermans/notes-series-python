"""
    Expression is a combination of values, variables, operators, and function calls that evaluates to a single value. 
    Expressions can be as simple as a single variable or as complex as a combination of operations.

    How Python Evaluates Expressions
    Python follows operator precedence (similar to math rules):
        - Parentheses () (highest priority)
        - Exponents **
        - Multiplication *, Division /, Floor Division //, Modulus %
        - Addition +, Subtraction -
        - Comparison (<, >, ==, etc.)
        - Logical not, and, or
        - Bitwise operators (&, |, ^, ~)
        - Identity operators (is, is not)
        - Membership operators (in, not in)
        - Assignment operators (=, +=, -=, etc.)
        - Conditional expressions (ternary operator)
        - Lambda expressions (anonymous functions)
    
    Example of operator precedence:
        - result = (5 + 3) * 2 ** 2  # (8) * (4) â†’ 32
        - total = (10 + 5) * 2  # 30
        - if (age >= 18) and (has_id):
            print("Allowed")
        - print("Sum:", (x + y))

"""
     Logical Expressions | Using logical operators to combine boolean values.
"""
