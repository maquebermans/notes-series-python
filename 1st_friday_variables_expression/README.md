Today is my first day learning python from basic. Although I have created automation scripts using python before, while taking this python programming basics course, I still feel like I have to learn more.

## 🍕 Today's menu

- Expressions

## 🍦 Bonus
- Constant variables in python (kind of tricky 😄)
